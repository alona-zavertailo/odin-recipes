    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cheesecake Layer:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Pumpkin Layer:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cloves, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large
        bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time,
        blending well after each addition. Spread 1 cup batter in the graham
        cracker crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to
        the remaining batter; stir gently until well blended. Carefully spread
        on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is
        firm except for a small spot in the center that jiggled when the pan is
        gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature,
        1 to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
